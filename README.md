## My Advent of Code 2022 solution

I love challenges and one thing I didn't mention during the interview is that I love solving coding puzzles.
One of my favorite recent descoveries is the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) and I've started to solve the challenges in JavaScript, but decided to solve the latest challenge (Day 5) in Python.

### How to use?

1. Install dependencies
`$ poetry install`
2. Start a poetry shell to load the virtual environment
`$ poetry shell`
3. Execute the solution file.
`$ python src/solutions/day5.py` or `cd src/solutions; python day5.py`
