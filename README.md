## My Advent of Code 2022 solution

I love challenges and one thing I didn't mention during the interview is that I love solving coding puzzles.
One of my favorite recent descoveries is the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) and I've started to solve the challenges in JavaScript, but decided to solve the latest challenge (Day 6) in Python.

### How to use?
1. Install dependencies
   `$ poetry install`
2. Make sure to source the `.env` file, it will set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.
   `$ source .env`
3. Execute the solution file.
   `$ python src/solutions/day6.py` or `cd src/solutions; python day6.py`
